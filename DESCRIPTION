Description: Simulation of life histories in continuous time using individual-level state transition (multi-state) models. Lifespans and fertility histories are generated using data from the Human Mortality Database and the Human Fertility Database. To facilitate data analysis, the virtual observations are stored in a data structure commonly used in sample surveys. Genealogies are created to facilitate the study of family ties.
